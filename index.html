	<h2>What's my opinion?</h2>
	<p>The research assisted the author's main point “Data Analysis: A stomach fullness index (FI) was calculated for each fish by dividing the weight of the gut content by the weight of the fish. To test whether stomach fullness had any effect on microplastics being present or not in the alimentary tract of the fish, a Mann-Whitney-U-test (as the distribution of FI was non-parametric) was carried out using R (R Development Core Team, 2017) and compared the median stomach fullness value for fish that had microplastics with those that did not. As the microplastic count data were non-parametric, a Kruskal–Wallis test (using R) was used to test whether there was any difference in the abundance of microplastics between the seven different species. A Mann–Whitney-U-test (using R), was used to test whether more microplastics were identified from fish found in shallow water compared with those found in deep waters.”</p>

	<h2>What assumptions does the research make?</h2>
	<p>The research assumes “The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.”</p>

	<h2>How would I improve the study?</h2>
	<p>The study could be conducted in other waters, organized into categories based on how close to humans they are. </p>

	<h2>How to research the research?</h2>
	<p>The author linked the study and I was able to comprehend it after reading and re-reading it. “Microplastics can be toxic to wildlife on their own, but they can also act like sponges, soaking up other toxins in the water. Worse, they can be ingested by all sorts of marine wildlife and accumulate in the food chain. A recent study found around 73 percent of fish caught at mid-ocean depths in the Northwest Atlantic had microplastic in their stomachs. Even the animals that live in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, are eating microfibers.” </p>
